## How to Test

Run the solution with TypeScript and Node.js:

```bash
npx tsx solution.ts
```

This will execute all three implementations and display their test results.

## Implementations

- `sum_to_n_a`: Mathematical formula approach
- `sum_to_n_b`: For loop approach
- `sum_to_n_c`: Recursive approach
